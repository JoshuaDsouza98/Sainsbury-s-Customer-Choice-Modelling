# Sainsbury-s-Customer-Choice-Modelling

### Business Objective: 
This project's initiative aims to comprehensively analyze the decision-making process and influential factors guiding customers' product selection, specifically bagels at Sainsbury's supermarkets across multiple store locations.

### Methodology: 
To achieve our objectives, an extensive data analysis was conducted to comprehend its characteristics and influencing factors. The dataset was stratified into low and medium product sales volumes. Additionally, segmentation was applied to supermarkets based on geographical zones and product brands. A comprehensive evaluation of supervised ML algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, KNN and Neural Networks, was meticulously carried out. Among these ML algorithms, XGBoost emerged as the top performer, exhibiting the highest accuracy and the most favourable weighted F1 score.

### Insights:
The segmented data showed distinct patterns. While top-predicted items aligned across zones, variations were noted in the least-predicted items, underscoring regional differences. In low-volume sales, consistent top-item selections were seen, while high-volume sales had different preferences. Brand-wise analysis highlighted top items for Brand A and Brand C. 

### Impact:
These insights enable Sainsbury's to optimize product assortment, ensuring high-demand items are always available. It helps assess customer price sensitivity for revenue maximization and balanced pricing. Using choice modelling, Sainsbury's can enhance targeted marketing, streamline supply chain management, and minimize stockouts, improving operational efficiency.

### Conclusion:
The analysis of bagel selection at Sainsbury's provides valuable insights for optimizing product assortment, pricing, and marketing, enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, aligning with customer preferences, and fostering long-term success.

### Note: The data has undergone encoding procedures to uphold privacy and confidentiality.
